"All I leave in my path is scrap metal. Don't get in my way."

[FragStrings]
"Another kill. Am I fighting machines or children?"
"You don't stand a chance."
"Oh, you didn't see me there? That's too bad."
"You should have ran at the sight of me."

[KilledStrings]
"Defeated?! Must have been a fluke."
"I just let my guard down. That's all."
"Next time you won't be so lucky..."

[RareRoamingStrings]
"I was thinking of clubbing some seals after this..."

[RoamingStrings]
"Why are you hiding? It just delays the inevitable."
"Check behind you, $player_random_notself..."
"Are you dead yet? I don't have much time to waste."

[EnragedStrings]
"Hmph. You don't know who you're messing with."

[WinStrings]
"All in a day's work. I have more robots to destroy."
"You haven't seen nothing yet."

[LoseStrings]
"Failure...How can I make up for this?"
"Don'ÃÂt think this is the end!"
